  -The number of correct digits  
    --This is the number of digits in your guess that match with the digits in the number to guess  
  -The number of digits in the correct position  
    --This is the number of correct digits whose position in the number also matches withthe number to guess  
   
 This will repeat upto the number of tries specified  
 
 Example -   
     --How many digits should the random number have? (3-9)  
     --4 --> Input by the user for number of digits in the number to guess  
     --Can the number have repeated digits?(y/n)  
     --n --> Input by the user specifying that the number cannot have repeated digits
